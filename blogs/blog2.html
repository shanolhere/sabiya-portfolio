              Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
              Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
              type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
              sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
              including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
            text-indent: 1.8rem; text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
              There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
               by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
                Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
                Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
                generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
                injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

              "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a
               complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
               human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
               know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves
                or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
                toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
                 exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
                 pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
